         Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer is a team sport played between
        two teams of 11 players each, who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular 
        field called a pitch. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by 
        moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. 
        Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 
        90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, 
        it is the world's most popular sport.

        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre 
        of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails 
        balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the 
        wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side 
        tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to 
        either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being 
        bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either
        catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket
         with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have
        been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two 
        umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate
        with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.

        A film also called a movie, motion picture, moving picture, picture, photoplay or (slang) flick 
        is a work of visual art that simulates experiences and otherwise communicates ideas, stories, 
        perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images. These images are 
        generally accompanied by sound and, more rarely, other sensory stimulations.The word "cinema", 
        short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and the art 
        form that is the result of it.

        News is information about current events. This may be provided through many different media: 
        word of mouth, printing, postal systems, broadcasting, electronic communication, or through the
         testimony of observers and witnesses to events. News is sometimes called "hard news" to
          differentiate it from soft media.
