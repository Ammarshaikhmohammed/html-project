          Code Complete is a software development book, written by Steve
          McConnell and published in 1993 by Microsoft Press, encouraging
          developers to continue past code-and-fix programming and the big
          design up front and waterfall models. It is also a compendium of
          software construction techniques, which include techniques from naming
          variables to deciding when to write a subroutine.

          The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master is a book about
          computer programming and software engineering, written by Andrew Hunt
          and David Thomas and published in October 1999.It is used as a
          textbook in related university courses. It was the first in a series
          of books under the label The Pragmatic Bookshelf. A second edition,
          The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery was released in 2019
          for the book's 20th anniversary, with major revisions and new material
          reflecting changes in the industry over the last twenty years.

          Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the
          principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second
          part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each
          case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code
          base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The
          third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of
          heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The
          result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we
          write, read, and clean code.

          Introduction to Algorithms is a book on computer programming by Thomas
          H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.
          The book has been widely used as the textbook for algorithms courses
          at many universities and is commonly cited as a reference for
          algorithms in published papers, with over 10,000 citations documented
          on CiteSeerX. The book sold half a million copies during its first 20
          years.Its fame has led to the common use of the abbreviation "CLRS"
          (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein), or, in the first edition, "CLR"
          (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest).

          Jon Bentley's collection of programming pearls is commonly included
          among the classics. Just as natural pearls grow from grains of sand
          that irritate oysters, programming pearls have grown from real
          problems that have irritated real programmers. With origins beyond
          solid engineering, in the realm of insight and creativity, Bentley's
          pearls offer unique and clever solutions to those nagging problems.
          Illustrated by programs designed as much for fun as for instruction,
          the book is filled with lucid and witty descriptions of practical
          programming techniques and fundamental design principles. It is not at
          all surprising that Programming Pearls has been so highly valued by
          programmers at every level of experience.
